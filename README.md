# CS190 Health Intelligence
## *by Jeremy Yang, Raymond Nguyen, Fandy Li*

This is our group project for CS190 Health Intelligence.  We predict food grades based on the National French Health grade.  Our dataset is gathered from an open-source database of foods called OpenFoodFacts. 
Note: the dataset and saved model is to big to include in repository.
